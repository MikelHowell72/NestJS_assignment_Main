## Summary of the technologies used

I used the following technologies in this project:

    =======> Implementing CRUD features on multiple endpoints using NestJS API.
    =======> Seamless reading/writing of data to PostgreSQL database using TypeORM.
    =======> Use of class-validator and class-transformer for input validation and serialization.
    =======> Use of RBAC(Role Based Authorization Control)-based User Authorization for Cat's create, update, and delete.


Finally, I added screenshots, database(database.sql file), and postman API JSON files to the images folder of the project.

Thanks for your attention.

Have a good day!!!
